BWS-cli
=======

BioID Web Service command line interface.

The *BWScli* is a simple Windows command line interface that executes a single command at a **BioID Web Service** (BWS) via SOAP.
The BWS in turn is a cloud-based online service providing a powerful multimodal biometric technology with liveness detection to developers of any service or software with access to the Internet.

To run the BWS command line interface you need to have access to an existing BWS installation. If you don't have this access you can [register for a trial instance](https://playground.bioid.com/BioIDWebService/TrialInstanceRequisition).

As soon as you have access to a BioID Web Service, you simply have to modify the app config file (or the *BWScli.exe.config* in the bin folder) with your access data, i.e. the BWS host name and your BWS X.509 certificate information.

If you want to know more about the BWS or want to play with it online, feel free to visit our [Playground web site](https://playground.bioid.com).
